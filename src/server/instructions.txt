I need to create a Node.js server file named server.js.

This server must use Express and the @xenova/transformers library.

It should:

Initialize an Express app.

Use the express.json() middleware to parse JSON bodies.

Define a singleton class named ValidatorPipeline to load the model. This is critical for performance, as the model should only be loaded once when the server starts, not on every API request.

The ValidatorPipeline class should load the 'Xenova/owlvit-base-patch32' model for the 'zero-shot-object-detection' task.

Create a POST endpoint at /validate-image.

This endpoint must read a JSON body containing image_url (a string) and queries (an array of strings).

Inside the endpoint, it should get the validator instance and run the detection on the image_url using the provided queries.

Finally, the endpoint should return the JSON array of findings (the objects detected by the model).

The server should listen on port 3000 and log a message.

Please provide the complete, commented server.js file.
